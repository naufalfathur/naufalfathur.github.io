For team collaboration in development phase, we have used Github platform as collaboration tool to discover and share our codes in building MyVote. 
We use Laravel Framework for development with PHP language. The reasons is Laravel have a built-in security features such as authentication, MVC architecture support, Automation of Testing work.
