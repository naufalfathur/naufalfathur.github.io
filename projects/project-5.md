Car health is crucial during these COVID-19 phases, where we rarely use cars because of restricted movement orders that make car engines rarely used which will cause damage to the car. at a time like this, to service a car will have a very long queue (because the worker and the customer will be limited) and ineffective. ServiceMate is an application to book a car service that aims to provide the effectiveness of customers in servicing their cars, without the need to queue at the car dealer service.

This project is for Mobile Application Course in my University and part of the learning process only, no database connected in this app.

For this project, I was learning on android application development using Android Studio and Java. I started by programming the basics, such as creating Layout, coding the program, designing the UI, etc. I was happy because I manage to learnt the basic of android development quickly with the help of internet. From there, I then programmed the app to be able to fulfil all the requirements and features. Then, completed successfully and achieved satisfactory results during the demo.
