Helped in integrating routine maintenance report from multiple ATM booths managed by the company across Indonesia
and Providing maintenance portofolio to increase company’s credibility and clients’ reliability.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
